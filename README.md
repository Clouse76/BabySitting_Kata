# BabySitting_Kata
This is my first GitHub. 
This is just a simple WFP program I created using Visual Studio 2017.
All you really need to do is download the project files and compile them.

From the Client:
Background
This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward.

The babysitter:

starts no earlier than 5:00PM
leaves no later than 4:00AM
gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
Feature
As a babysitter
In order to get paid for 1 night of work
I want to calculate my nightly charge
